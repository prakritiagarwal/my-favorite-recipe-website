  <h1>Step by step directions to make Paneer Tikka Masala recipe</h1> 
 <ol>
      <li><h3>Cut paneer cubes and vegetables</h3>First, cut about six or more pieces of paneer and some <i>capsicum, onion and tomato</i> for the recipe. Once all the fresh ingredients are nicely diced, it’s time to prepare the masala.</li>
      <li><h3> Prepare masala for paneer</h3>To prepare the masala, take a bowl and add two tablespoons hung curd, 1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste, 1 tablespoon Degi Mirch, half tablespoon salt, some black salt, 1 tablespoon garam masala, 1 tablespoon kitchen king, 2 tablespoon mustard oil, and 1 tablespoon green chilli paste for a spicy flavour. Now, mix all these ingredients well to make a thick paste.</li>
      <li><h3>Soak paneer and veggies in masala</h3></li>Now add diced paneer cubes and vegetables (capsicum, large tomato and large onion) to the prepared masala. Mix everything well with hands to ensure paneer and veggies are coated with masala properly.
      <li><h3> Leave the mixture in the fridge for 5 to 6 minutes</h3></li>Cover the bowl and keep the ingredients in the fridge for about five to six minutes. This step is important to ensure that the vegetables and paneer absorb as much masala as possible.
      <li><h3>Put masala coated paneer and vegetables on skewers:</h3></li>After five minutes, it’s time to put paneer and vegetables on skewers. Gently put the ingredients without tearing them off completely. Now put the skewer into a hot tandoor and leave it for 10 minutes. When the cubes are reddish-brown, the dish is ready to be served.
      <li><h3>Take out the paneer tikka from the tandoor:</h3></li>Now it’s time to take out paneer tikka on the plate. Don’t put them directly on paper tissues because the heat and moisture content from paneer cubes can easily stick to paper tissues. So, always put them on the plate directly.
